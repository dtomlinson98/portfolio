        complete on the Snap-on Tool website. Your objective is to explore the
        website organically, as you would in real-life situations. We're
        interested in uncovering any pain-points or areas where the website
        excels. If you encounter any challenges, don't hesitate to shareâ€”it
        helps us address user needs effectively.
