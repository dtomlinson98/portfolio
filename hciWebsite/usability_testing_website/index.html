      <p>
        Welcome to my website dedicated to reviewing and analyzing the Snap On
        website. My goal is to examine the design, usability, and functionality
        of Snap On's website. As a well-known and highly regarded brand, Snap On
        tools demand a premium price point. However, despite its reputation, the
        website design falls short in various aspects.

      <h2>Why Snap On?</h2>

      <p>
        I have chosen to focus on the Snap On website due to its status as a
        large brand that surprisingly showcases a poor website design. I aim to
        conduct a heuristic evaluation and provide constructive feedback to help
        identify areas of improvement.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>

      <p>
        While the Snap On website has several weaknesses, it does have a few
        areas where it performs relatively well. One well executed aspect is its
        provision of necessary information on franchising opportunities.
        Additionally, the product page is presented in an organized and visually
        appealing manner, allowing users to browse through their offerings.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the website falls short in conveying its purpose clearly to
        users. The overall design lacks flexibility, making it challenging for
        users to navigate and find what they are looking for. The design choices
        are cluttered and do not prioritize clean and functional layouts.
        Furthermore, the website's overall functionality remains unclear,
        leading to confusion and frustration for users.
      </p>

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>

      <p>
        I will also be constructing usability tests to further analyze the user
        experience of the Snap On website. By conducting these tests, I aim to
        identify specific pain points and gather valuable insights to offer
        recommendations for enhancing usability and user satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please explore this website to observe our findings and make your own
        conclusion about the effectiveness of Snap On's website.
