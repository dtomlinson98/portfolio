      <ul>
        <li>Navigation</li>
        <p>
          The navigation system needs to be addressed urgently. The current
          system is very confusing to users.The new system should not force
          users to make a selection at each branch of the navigation tree.
        </p>
        <li>Information</li>
        <p>
          The goal of the site is to sell tools. Therefore the information that
          will help a consumer make a decison on purchasing a product should be
          more accessible. Items like reviews, product videos, and comparions
          should be more visible.
        </p>
        <li>Strict Paths</li>
        <p>
          Many of the actions a user must perform involve following a strict
          path. Each decision a user makes is met with another. Many of the
          choices are unclear and leave the user unsure if they made the right
          choice. When they complete the path and don't find what they were
          looking for, they are left to wonder if they made a wrong choice
          earlier.
        </p>
        <li>Simplify Buttons</li>
        <p>
          Many of the button and action elements are too complex. The "Browse
          Product Categories" could be simplified to a button that says shop or
          just a simple icon. This excessive wording is a theme that is carried
          out throughout the website and should be cut down.
        </p>
        <li>Shopping Cart</li>
        <p>
          An issue involving the cart element of the website was leading users
          to be confused about what was actually in their cart. This is a
          functional issue that is confusing and frustrating users.
        </p>
        <li>Guest Option</li>
        <p>
          Many users are hesitant to create an account on a website especially
          if it is their first time on the website. Adding a guest option would
          decrease the amount of barriers between the consumber and a purchase.
